Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Claudio Silva](https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/). I hold a B.S. in Physics (2014) and M.Sc. in High Energy Physics (2016) from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv ([KNU](http://www.univ.kiev.ua/en/)), Ukraine.

I come from the City of Lviv, a cultural center of Ukraine, where I was studying at Physics and Mathematics Lyceum of Lviv ([LPML](https://www.lpml.com.ua/)). In 2010, I moved to capital to pursue my Bachelors and Masters degrees, and in 2016, I moved to New York to do my PhD.

At NYU, I'm working as research assistant in Visualization and Data Analytics Lab ([ViDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/)) and Center for Urban Science + Progress ([CUSP](https://cusp.nyu.edu/)). My work is focused on imaging for sports analytics, computer graphics and urban sensing. The two major projects I'm currently working on are:
- LegoTracker - an intelligent modular system for large-scale sports tracking, and
- Reconfigurable Environmental Inteligence Platform (REIP) - a remote sensing infrastructure with advanced edge processing capabilities for in situ insight generation.

I identify myself as a hardware person and my past work also includes development of the Associative Memory chip testbench based on FPGA technology.

In my free time, I like to study foreign languages and voluteer for [Razom Ticket](https://razomforukraine.org/projects/ticket/) project.
